&lt;p&gt;This privacy policy (&amp;quot;Policy&amp;quot;) describes how Website Operator (&amp;quot;Website Operator&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;we&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;us&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;our&amp;quot;) collects, protects and uses the personally identifiable information (&amp;quot;Personal Information&amp;quot;) you (&amp;quot;User&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;you&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;your&amp;quot;) may provide on the &lt;a target&#x3D;&quot;_blank&quot; rel&#x3D;&quot;nofollow&quot; href&#x3D;&quot;https://billit.tk&quot;&gt;billit.tk&lt;/a&gt; website and any of its products or services (collectively, &amp;quot;Website&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Services&amp;quot;). It also describes the choices available to you regarding our use of your Personal Information and how you can access and update this information. This Policy does not apply to the practices of companies that we do not own or control, or to individuals that we do not employ or manage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Collection of personal information&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We receive and store any information you knowingly provide to us when you create an account, fill any online forms on the Website.  When required this information may include your email address,  or other Personal Information. You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of some of the Website&#x27;s features. Users who are uncertain about what information is mandatory are welcome to contact us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Collection of non-personal information&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you visit the Website our servers automatically record information that your browser sends. This data may include information such as your device&#x27;s IP address, browser type and version, operating system type and version, language preferences or the webpage you were visiting before you came to our Website, pages of our Website that you visit, the time spent on those pages, information you search for on our Website, access times and dates, and other statistics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Use and processing of collected information&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any of the information we collect from you may be used to personalize your experience; improve our Website; improve customer service and respond to queries and emails of our customers; send notification emails such as password reminders, updates, etc;  run and operate our Website and Services. Non-Personal Information collected is used only to identify potential cases of abuse and establish statistical information regarding Website usage. This statistical information is not otherwise aggregated in such a way that would identify any particular user of the system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We may process Personal Information related to you if one of the following applies: (i) You have given your consent for one or more specific purposes. Note that under some legislations we may be allowed to process information until you object to such processing (by opting out), without having to rely on consent or any other of the following legal bases below. This, however, does not apply, whenever the processing of Personal Information is subject to European data protection law; (ii) Provision of information is necessary for the performance of an agreement with you and/or for any pre-contractual obligations thereof; (iii) Processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which you are subject; (iv) Processing is related to a task that is carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in us; (v) Processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by us or by a third party. In any case, we will be happy to clarify the specific legal basis that applies to the processing, and in particular whether the provision of Personal Data is a statutory or contractual requirement, or a requirement necessary to enter into a contract.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Information transfer and storage&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Depending on your location, data transfers may involve transferring and storing your information in a country other than your own. You are entitled to learn about the legal basis of information transfers to a country outside the European Union or to any international organization governed by public international law or set up by two or more countries, such as the UN, and about the security measures taken by us to safeguard your information. If any such transfer takes place, you can find out more by checking the relevant sections of this document or inquire with us using the information provided in the contact section.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The rights of users&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may exercise certain rights regarding your information processed by us. In particular, you have the right to do the following: (i) you have the right to withdraw consent where you have previously given your consent to the processing of your information; (ii) you have the right to object to the processing of your information if the processing is carried out on a legal basis other than consent; (iii) you have the right to learn if information is being processed by us, obtain disclosure regarding certain aspects of the processing and obtain a copy of the information undergoing processing; (iv) you have the right to verify the accuracy of your information and ask for it to be updated or corrected; (v) you have the right, under certain circumstances, to restrict the processing of your information, in which case, we will not process your information for any purpose other than storing it; (vi) you have the right, under certain circumstances, to obtain the erasure of your Personal Information from us; (vii) you have the right to receive your information in a structured, commonly used and machine readable format and, if technically feasible, to have it transmitted to another controller without any hindrance. This provision is applicable provided that your information is processed by automated means and that the processing is based on your consent, on a contract which you are part of or on pre-contractual obligations thereof.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The right to object to processing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where Personal Information is processed for the public interest, in the exercise of an official authority vested in us or for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by us, you may object to such processing by providing a ground related to your particular situation to justify the objection. You must know that, however, should your Personal Information be processed for direct marketing purposes, you can object to that processing at any time without providing any justification. To learn, whether we are processing Personal Information for direct marketing purposes, you may refer to the relevant sections of this document.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;How to exercise these rights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any requests to exercise User rights can be directed to the Owner through the contact details provided in this document. These requests can be exercised free of charge and will be addressed by the Owner as early as possible and always within one month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Privacy of children&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We do not knowingly collect any Personal Information from children under the age of 13. If you are under the age of 13, please do not submit any Personal Information through our Website or Service. We encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their children&#x27;s Internet usage and to help enforce this Policy by instructing their children never to provide Personal Information through our Website or Service without their permission. If you have reason to believe that a child under the age of 13 has provided Personal Information to us through our Website or Service, please contact us. You must also be at least 16 years of age to consent to the processing of your personal data in your country (in some countries we may allow your parent or guardian to do so on your behalf).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Cookies&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Website uses &amp;quot;cookies&amp;quot; to help personalize your online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you. We may use cookies to collect, store, and track information for statistical purposes to operate our Website and Services. You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you will not be able to use and experience the features of the Website and Services. To learn more about cookies and how to manage them, visit &lt;a target&#x3D;&quot;_blank&quot; href&#x3D;&quot;https://www.internetcookies.org&quot;&gt;internetcookies.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Do Not Track signals&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some browsers incorporate a Do Not Track feature that signals to websites you visit that you do not want to have your online activity tracked. Tracking is not the same as using or collecting information in connection with a website. For these purposes, tracking refers to collecting personally identifiable information from consumers who use or visit a website or online service as they move across different websites over time. How browsers communicate the Do Not Track signal is not yet uniform. As a result, this Website is not yet set up to interpret or respond to Do Not Track signals communicated by your browser. Even so, as described in more detail throughout this Policy, we limit our use and collection of your personal information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Links to other websites&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our Website contains links to other websites that are not owned or controlled by us. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other websites or third-parties. We encourage you to be aware when you leave our Website and to read the privacy statements of each and every website that may collect Personal Information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Information security&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We secure information you provide on computer servers in a controlled, secure environment, protected from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. We maintain reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards in an effort to protect against unauthorized access, use, modification, and disclosure of Personal Information in its control and custody. However, no data transmission over the Internet or wireless network can be guaranteed. Therefore, while we strive to protect your Personal Information, you acknowledge that (i) there are security and privacy limitations of the Internet which are beyond our control; (ii) the security, integrity, and privacy of any and all information and data exchanged between you and our Website cannot be guaranteed; and (iii) any such information and data may be viewed or tampered with in transit by a third-party, despite best efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Data breach&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the event we become aware that the security of the Website has been compromised or users Personal Information has been disclosed to unrelated third parties as a result of external activity, including, but not limited to, security attacks or fraud, we reserve the right to take reasonably appropriate measures, including, but not limited to, investigation and reporting, as well as notification to and cooperation with law enforcement authorities. In the event of a data breach, we will make reasonable efforts to notify affected individuals if we believe that there is a reasonable risk of harm to the user as a result of the breach or if notice is otherwise required by law. When we do, we will send you an email.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Changes and amendments&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We reserve the right to modify this Policy relating to the Website or Services at any time, effective upon posting of an updated version of this Policy on the Website. When we do we will revise the updated date at the bottom of this page. Continued use of the Website after any such changes shall constitute your consent to such changes. Policy was created with &lt;a style&#x3D;&quot;color:inherit&quot; target&#x3D;&quot;_blank&quot; title&#x3D;&quot;Generate privacy policy&quot; href&#x3D;&quot;https://www.websitepolicies.com/blog/sample-privacy-policy-template&quot;&gt;WebsitePolicies&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
